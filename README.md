# sound-of-thought
Written in ssh terminal at Adam Mickiewicz University physics faculty from home.

1. no sound (wave), no motion -> nothing
2. everything is in motion and has certain sound (wave)
3. as motion changes, sound changes
4. everything is under influence of electricity and electricity is self-organizing
5. electricity in smaller bodies acts in less dimensions than in larger objects
6. waves are propagated through space enabling charging objects at distance
7. charging spreads like a virus through small bodies and large objects
8. thought is charge

2023 Addendum:

From smaller particles, while they are charging each other, into bigger objects
there is nothing else than logic. Bits. It's time for qubits to understand what they
did. My cat eats grass and grain food. We don't need wars, but thoughts and ideas
are polarized in between humans, and since thought can be spread in the speed of Tweet
_the ministry of thought_ is not a long shot.
